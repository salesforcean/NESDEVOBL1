    <description>Logic for evaluation of the component&apos;s associated criteria groups against each other. If the logic evaluates to true, it indicates that the component is relevant to the program enrollment the evaluation was completed for and it would then be assigned to the PE through a Enrollment Component Affiliation. If there is no assignment logic defined on a component, it inherits it&apos;s assigment from its parent.</description>
