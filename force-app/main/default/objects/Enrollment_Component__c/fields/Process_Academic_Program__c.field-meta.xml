    <description>The academic program associated with the component. This is exclusively used by components with a record type of Process to create a relationship between the account entity and it&apos;s required components. As the child components of the process could be used by multiple processes, there is not a direct relationship between them and a specific academic program and those relationships are inferred from their parent process.</description>
